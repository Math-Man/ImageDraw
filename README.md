# ImageDraw
This is a C# side project built under 36 hours as an experiment.


Program takes an image and various parameters as input and attempts to recrate that image by placing pixels on a bitmap in real time
Almost every control has a tooltip explaining what the parameters do, also image can be saved at any time while being drawn.

I might add a "genetic algorithm" later on since I already have the groundwork setup.
